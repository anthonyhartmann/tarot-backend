You will need to take control of your situation and ownership of your choices in order to learn from this situation.

These ups and downs are part of life and often we learn more from hardship than we do from good fortune.",major,"Good luck, destiny, change, karma, soulmates, decisive moments, cycles of life, fate, fortune, upheaval, chance","Bad luck, upheaval, disorder, external forces, lack of control, disruption, unwelcome change, delays, set backs"
Justice,"The Justice Tarot card relates to karmic justice, legal matters and cause and effect. In a general context Justice is showing you that all actions have consequences.

This is usually a favourable omen if you are involved in a legal dispute. Justice is concerned with truth and integrity, so you may find yourself compelled to speak the truth and that you more than ever value honesty and integrity in others.

Even if you didn’t create the situation, you can choose how you react to it and that can be a lesson in itself. Justice in a reversed position can also be an indicator of someone trying to avoid their karma.

Don’t try to blame others or avoid the consequences, just learn from it and move forward a little wiser and more self-aware. The Justice Tarot card reversed can also indicate dishonesty.

This Major Arcana trump card generally shows that you may be jumping from one bad situation to the next without considering where this behaviour is taking you. Ask yourself if there are feelings you trying to avoid confronting or changes that you know need to be made but are reluctant to tackle. If there are, consider what you fear will happen if you do? If you genuinely don’t know what to do in terms of your direction in life, just stop, breathe and wait for things to become clearer. However, if you know your behaviour patterns are not working for you, change them. Your attitude towards your life will determine life’s attitude towards you!",major,"Feeling trapped, confined, self-limiting, uncertainty, lack of direction, needing release, letting go","Discontentment, apathy, disinterest, stagnation, impulsiveness, negative patterns, detachment"
Death,"Although it is the Tarot card that many people fear, Death generally does not mean physical death. As a rule you should never predict deaths (or the outcomes of illnesses or pregnancies for that matter) as a Tarot reader. It is unethical and irresponsible. Aside from the ethics, The Death Tarot Card usually signifies spiritual transformation and a time of change and new beginnings, not actual death! The transformation or change that Death can bring can be difficult, unexpected, sudden or even traumatic but it will bring with it a new lease of life. Its best to try not to resist the change the Death Tarot card brings as resisting it will only make the transition difficult and painful. Instead try to embrace the change as a fresh start. This Major Arcana card can also signify the need to let go of old issues or beliefs when it appears in a Tarot spread. It may be telling you that you need to draw a line under the past in order to move forward in a positive direction. A Death card transformation can be a bit of a shock to the system but ultimately it’s a positive one.","In a general context, Death reversed indicates that you are resisting a change that is necessary for you to move forward. Nothing new can begin while you are holding on to this old negative energy. Death indicates that while you are finding it difficult to let go, once you do, new energy will come into your life to give you a new brighter beginning. The change the Death Tarot card reversed brings is not something you can resist forever, if you keep holding onto the things you should be letting go of, the universe will find a way to push you on to your life path in its own way. The universe’s way of getting you to where you’re supposed to be, if you resist it, can be shocking and distressing. It’s much better to make you way to your correct path rather than getting a jolt that forces you onto it. At least if you make a decision to let go of old situations, old issues or relationships you will feel empowered that you made a decision to end what wasn’t working for you. When you think of the change you are resisting, ask yourself realistically is it going to make you feel worse than staying in your current situation indefinitely or could it possibly lead you to something amazing?",major,"Spiritual transformation, new beginnings, letting go, endings, change, transition, sudden or unexpected upheaval","Inability to move forward, fear of beginnings, repeating negative patterns, resisting change, dependency"

Instead you adapt to the situations with a clear mind and calm heart and keep your balance. Temperance can also signify that you have found peace and tranquillity and you are feeling content. Temperance indicates that you are truly in touch with who you are inside, what you value and your own moral compass and you are finding it easier to figure out your aspirations and set yourself goals.","In a general context, Temperance reversed indicates imbalance or overindulgence. This Major Arcana card can be an indicator that you are behaving in a hasty or reckless fashion. It can be a signifier of many issues with excessive or harmful indulgences such as drinking, drug use, gambling, overeating, shopping and the list goes on. The Temperance Tarot card in a reversed position may be telling you that you have lost touch with your own inner calm and tranquillity which can lead you to seek gratification in risky, harmful ways. Temperance reversed can also indicate a lack of harmony with the people in your life so you may find yourself clashing with those closest to you or allowing yourself to be dragged into other people’s drama. You may be lacking perspective and not looking at the bigger picture. You would do well to take a step back and take a look at how you are behaving, examine the root causes and work on resolving them.",major,"Balance, peace, patience, moderation, inner calm, perspective, tranquillity, harmonious relationships, soulmates","Imbalance, self-indulgence, excess, clashing, lack of perspective, discord, antagonism, recklessness, hastiness"
The Devil,"In a general context, The Devil Tarot card can signify depression or addiction. It can also be a sign of feeling trapped or restricted. With this Major Arcana card in your Tarot spread you may feel as though outside influences or forces beyond your control are restricting you, leaving you feeling powerless and victimised. However, this is the illusion The Devil creates. You are in control of your own destiny and are not bound by anything other than your own attitudes and behaviour. Don’t give up and don’t give away your power. You don’t have to tolerate negativity, criticism, manipulation or abuse from anyone. There are always options and there is always something positive you can do to improve your situation no matter how hopeless things may seem on the surface. Likewise be mindful of how you are treating others and make sure you are not trying to manipulate or control people in your life either. The Devil upright in your Tarot reading can also indicate obsessive, secretive or impulsive behaviour. It can be a sign that you are out of control. The Devil Tarot card is also a signifier of materialism and may show that you have become overly concerned with material things, status or power. These are not things that will make you truly fulfilled as a person so put your energy into the things that will.","In a general context, The Devil reversed can signify that you are becoming aware of the things that have been trapping you and the role you play in allowing them to. It is a great card for anyone battling an addiction or mental illness or engaging in harmful behaviour as it indicates that you are starting to see the light and take back control of yourself and your life. You want to be free from these problems and you are starting to get the motivation to change your circumstances. It can also indicate that you are getting a new perspective on issues that you felt powerless to change previously. The changes you want to make may not be easy but they are necessary for you if you want to have a happy life in the future and you are beginning to realise what you have to do. The Devil Tarot card reversed can also indicate a near miss with a negative, harmful or dangerous situation or person. The important message this Major Arcana card brings is to be grateful that you avoided it, learn from it and move forward. Do not fall back into the old bad or risky behaviours that led you so close to danger. Don’t get cocky and think you are invincible if you managed to dodge the bullet. Appreciate your good fortune, but don’t push it!",major,"Addiction, depression, mental health issues, secrecy, obsession, cheating, dependency, bondage, materialism, sesxuality, powerlessness, hopelessness, abuse, violence, assault","Detachment, independence, overcoming addiction, freedom, revelation, reclaiming power, reasserting control"
The Tower,"Whereas the Death card is usually the card people are terrified of, out of all of the cards in the deck, The Tower is the one you really need to brace yourself for. The Tower Tarot card represents chaos and destruction. It is the Major Arcana card of sudden upheaval and unexpected change. This change usually is scary, life changing and often unavoidable. A negative Tower event can be akin to a bomb going off in your life. You don’t know how you will survive but somehow you will and later you will realise that while it was a tremendously difficult thing to go through and you wouldn’t wish it on your worst enemy, it has made you into the person you are. One positive aspect of The Tower is that the destruction it brings is usually directed at something that was built on a false beliefs and foundations or unrealistic goals and dreams. Also on the bright side, the destruction The Tower brings is always followed by renewal and creation. However, The Tower with a negative aspect can represent a whole host of tragic, traumatic or life-altering events like the death of a loved one, divorce, a bad breakup, assault, sexual assault, violence, abuse, stillbirth or miscarriage, bankruptcy, a drug overdose, a car crash or job loss to name but a few. It’s usually the kind of thing you hope will never happen to you. That said, not every Tower event denotes tragedy. If the surrounding cards are positive, The Tower can simply represent a big change, like going to live in another country. This will be a massive upheaval. It will be a scary adjustment and will change your life as you know it but ultimately the change will be a good one. Placement of The Tower is important too, in a past position in a Tarot spread it is telling you what you’ve been through. While there are some life-events that we cannot avoid, sometimes The Tower will appear in a future if you are on a path that is leading to danger to warn you to avoid it. For instance, if you tend to put yourself in dangerous situations without thinking of the consequences, The Tower may be a warning to be mindful of your safety. Or if you take big gambles with money, The Tower may be warning you that it’s time to start acting more responsibly to avert disaster. It can also warn of natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes etc.","The Tower Tarot card reversed can be a sign that you have narrowly avoided a disaster. You will need to learn from the experience in order to prevent the lesson from coming back around again. It can also signify delaying the inevitable. While we would all like to go through life without experiencing hardships, they are a necessary part of life. Without darkness how would we ever learn to appreciate the light? If you have been running from a big change because you fear the pain or heartache it will bring, this Major Arcana card in reversed position may be telling you it’s time to turn and face it. Avoiding it may seem like the easier option but if you do you’ll be running for the rest of your life. Confronting it won’t be easy but it will eventually lead you to a new beginning. If you have already experienced your Tower event, The Tower reversed warns you not to try and rebuild what you had but to seek something new and better to build in place of what was destroyed as it was destroyed for a reason. You need to let it go and focus on creating something new. It can also be a sign that you are trying to hold onto people that are no longer supporting you in the way they once did. You need to let go of them and let them go their own way, so new people can come into your life.",major,"Chaos, destruction, sudden upheaval, trauma, unexpected change, disaster, loss, tragedy, revelations, confusion, pain, divorce, abuse, violence, bankruptcy, natural disasters","Resisting change, averting disaster, avoiding tragedy, delaying the inevitable, avoiding loss"
